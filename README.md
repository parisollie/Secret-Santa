Problem Statement

Imagine your extended family does a "Secret Santa" gift exchange yearly. For this gift
exchange, each person randomly draws another person and gets a gift for them.
After the third year of doing the Secret Santa gift exchange, you hear complaints about having
the same Secret Santa for multiple years.

As your extended family has grown, members have married and had children. Those families
usually get gifts for their immediate family members, so they would like to have their immediate
family excluded from the Secret Santa.

#Homework

Write a program that will choose a Secret Santa for your extended family, given these
constraints:

● A person cannot be their own Secret Santa.
● A family member can only be paired with the same Secret Santa once every three years.
● Immediate Family Members cannot select other members of their immediate family.
